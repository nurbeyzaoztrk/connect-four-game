# Connect Four Game

Welcome to the Connect Four game project! This is a simple yet engaging game where you can play against the computer. The project consists of three screens: Create Game Screen, Game List Screen, and Game Screen.

## Screens

### 1. Create Game Screen

This screen allows the user to set up a new game. Here, the user needs to input their username and choose a game name. Additionally, the user can select their preferred color and board color. The entered data is stored in the localStorage for use in the subsequent screens.

### 2. Game List Screen

In this screen, the project lists the details of each player stored in the localStorage. Users can view their past game information and make informed decisions about their next moves.

### 3. Game Screen

The heart of the project lies in the Game Screen, where the Connect Four game board is displayed. The current player's turn is highlighted, and the winner is announced when a player succeeds. The page is refreshed if the game ends in a draw.
